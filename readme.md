# Google Dev

## Description

**2023-06-12:** I want to learn Android development. I've tried before and don't really like the style or content Google as adopted; but, I'm fed up of material that is not up-to-date or otherwise functionally lackluster.

I'm starting in with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, but may end up moving over to Flutter and Dart. As I am completley outside of the Apple ecosystem the officially supported Android methodology *should* be the most appropriate.
